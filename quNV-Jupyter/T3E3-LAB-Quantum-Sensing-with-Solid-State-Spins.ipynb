    "In Aim 1, you will first be characterizing the microwave cavities by measuring their resonance frequencies and quality factors. Recall that a cavity $Q$ is defined to be the ratio of its resonance frequency to its decay rate (also known as the cavity _linewidth_).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the $Q$ of a cavity with resonance frequency at 3 GHz and linewidth of 100 kHz.\n",
    "2. Typically the cavity linewidth is defined at the [full width at half maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum). Insert a cell below and write a Python script plotting a resonance peak centered at 3 GHz with linewidth of 100 kHz. Make the x-axis frequency with a span of 1 MHz and the y-axis normalized cavity transmission. Note that the cavity lineshape is usually [Lorentzian](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LorentzianFunction.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this session will ask you to characterize the [Helmholtz coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_coil) by measuring its generated magnetic field. Recall that due to the Zeeman effect, magnetic field is used to shift the energy (frequency) difference between the $m_s=0$ and $m_s=+1$ states of NV centers. Importantly, the correct amount of magnetic field must be applied to ensure the energy difference matches the microwave cavity's resonance frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The amount of frequency shift due to magnetic field strength $B$ is $\\delta f = \\mu B$, where $\\mu = \\mu_B g/h$. $\\mu_B$ is the [Bohr magneton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_magneton), $g\\approx 2$ is the Lande factor, and $h$ is the Planck constant. Calculate $\\mu$ in units of MHz/Gauss. Note the SI unit for magnetic field is Tesla, where 1 Tesla = $10^4$ Gauss.\n",
    "4. Calculate the needed magnetic field strength (in Gauss) if the cavity resonance frequency is at 3 GHz. Recall the starting point (due to crystal field splitting) of the energy difference between $m_s=0$ and $m_s=+1$ is 2.87 GHz."

    "### <u>For the following steps, please take extra care when handling the microwave cavities and the loop coupler!</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i) Estimate the cavity's resonance frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two microwave resonators provided to you. Both of them should have identical geometries, except with slightly different surface qualities. Take one of them and measure its outer radius and length. Use the measured geometry parameters and estimate the cavity's resonance frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you measure the resonance frequency via the VNA, whose bandwidth covers 100 kHz to 6 GHz?\n",
    "\n",
    "What would be the expected resonance frequency if you stack the two resonators on top of another, with their central holes as aligned as possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you measure the combined stack's resonance frequency via the VNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii) Build the RF circuitry for probing the cavity's resonance frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The VNA has a send port (Port 1) and a receive port (Port 2). Port 1 sends out a microwave tone by an internal signal generator, and port 2 measures the transmitted/reflected signal to compute the S-parameters. Use the provided [circulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulator) and note the numbers written on its, connect its ports to the VNA and the loop coupler appropriately such that the loop coupler can be used to probe the cavity's signal. Check with the TA after you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii) Measure the microwave resonator's frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with the loop coupler properly connected to the VNA via the circulator, first put on gloves and grab the pair of tweezers. Carefully place the resonator stack inside the magnetic shield on the cavity mount, as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "[FIGURE SHOWING MICROWAVE CAVITY STACK INSIDE THE MAGNETIC SHIELD]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mount the loop coupler such that it is directly above the resonator. You should use the [right-angle clamp](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=RA90) to adjust the loop coupler position, as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the libreVNA GUI and connect to the device. Make sure you are monitoring the \"S21\" window. Change the center frequency to what you estimated above for the stacked resonator. Change the span to 20 MHz. By adjusting the position of the loop coupler relative to the resonator, you should be able to observe the cavity resonance dip. Once you have done so, play around with the position of the loop coupler and observe how the cavity's observed loaded $Q$ and resonance frequency $\\omega_c$ change. Write down your observations and explanations to these changes as a function of position.\n"
