	abstract = {Precision measurements are important across all fields of science. In particular, optical phase measurements can be used to measure distance, position, displacement, acceleration, and optical path length. Quantum entanglement enables higher precision than would otherwise be possible. We demonstrated an optical phase measurement with an entangled four-photon interference visibility greater than the threshold to beat the standard quantum limit—the limit attainable without entanglement. These results open the way for new high-precision measurement applications.
Sets of four-entangled photons and their interference patterns can be used to yield precise measurements beyond the assumed limit.

	abstract = {Quantum metrology promises greater sensitivity for optical phase measurements than could ever be achieved classically. Here, we present a theory of the phase sensitivity for the general case where the detection probability is given by an N photon interference fringe. We find that the phase sensitivity has a complicated dependence on both the intrinsic efficiency of detection η and the interference fringe visibility V. Most importantly, the phase that gives maximum phase sensitivity is in general not the same as the phase at which the slope of the interference fringe is a maximum, as has previously been assumed. We determine the parameter range where quantum enhanced sensitivity can be achieved. In order to illustrate these theoretical results, we perform a four-photon experiment with η=3/4 and V=82±6\% (an extension of our previous work (Nagata et al 2007 Science 316 726)) and find a phase sensitivity 1.3 times greater than the standard quantum limit at a phase different to that which gives maximum slope of the interference fringe.},
